# Welcome to the Advanced Knowledge Agent

This agent uses a Wikipedia knowledge base to answer your questions. It employs a sophisticated search strategy:

1. Generates multiple search queries to find relevant information
2. Searches the knowledge base with each query
3. Analyzes search results to determine if they contain the answer
4. Refines search queries based on initial results if needed
5. Provides a comprehensive answer with supporting evidence

## Examples of questions you can ask:

- Who was the first person to walk on the moon?
- When was the Declaration of Independence signed?
- What is the capital of France?
- Who wrote the novel "Pride and Prejudice"?
- What happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis?

Feel free to ask any question, and the agent will search for an answer in its knowledge base!
